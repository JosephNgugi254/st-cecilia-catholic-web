      <h2 class="heading">OUR CHOIRS</h2>
      <p class="content">At our church, music plays a vital role in our worship experience. Each choir brings its unique flair and dedication to their respective masses held every Sunday, enriching our worship services with melodious hymns and spiritual resonance.
        We have two choirs namely:<br>        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. St. Joseph<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. St. Cecelia.<br>             
        In addition to our choir ministry, we also have a devotional group devoted to the Divine Mercy, a spiritual practice deeply rooted in the Catholic faith. This group holds monthly meetings, where members gather to reflect on the boundless compassion and mercy of our Lord. Furthermore, all our musical and devotional groups come together once a month for a seminar and a collective mass,
        fostering a sense of unity and fellowship within our church community.<br><br>        
        Through these musical and devotional endeavors, our church seeks to deepen our spiritual connection with God and one another, nurturing a sense of reverence, harmony, and devotion that resonates throughout our worship services and beyond. Join us as we lift our voices in praise and prayer, honoring the Divine and enriching our faith journey together.
