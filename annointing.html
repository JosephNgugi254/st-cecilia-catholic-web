          <p class="content">The Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick holds a sacred place within the life of the Church, offering comfort, healing, and spiritual strength to those who are suffering from illness or facing the end of their earthly life.
             At St. Cecilia Catholic Church, we hold this sacrament in high regard, recognizing it as a profound expression of God's love and mercy for His people.
            <br><br>The Anointing of the Sick is administered by a priest, who anoints the forehead and hands of the sick person with blessed oil, accompanied by prayers for healing and grace.
            This sacrament is not only a source of physical healing but also offers spiritual strength and peace,
            as it unites the recipient with the suffering of Christ and the hope of eternal life.
            <br><br>
            For more information or clarification contact the church office.
