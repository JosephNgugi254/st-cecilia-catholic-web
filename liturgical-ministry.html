    <h2 class="heading">OUR LITURGICAL MINISTRY</h2>
    <p class="content">The Catholic Men Association, referred to as CMA, is a gathering of committed Catholic men dedicated to participating actively in evangelization endeavors within their households,
      Small Christian Communities (SCC), parish, and wider society. Established in Kenya during the 1970s, this organization has thrived,
      empowering men within our parish to lead diverse initiatives
      aimed at enhancing the collective well-being of the congregation.</p>

    <h3 class="heading xl-10">Altar Servers</h3> 
    <p class="content">Altar Servers are dedicated individuals within our community, who fulfill a vital role in aiding priests before, during, and after Mass. Their silent yet profound contribution enhances the sacredness of the Mass, providing an avenue for engagement in the divine proceedings.
      Participation in training is mandatory for those wishing to serve in this capacity.
    </p>
    <h3 class="heading xl-10">Lectors</h3> 
    <p class="content">Lectors are entrusted with the sacred duty of proclaiming the Word of God, a task through which the power of His Word strengthens the faith of the congregation and extends an invitation to partake in the Eucharist.
      For further information or to access the lecture schedule, kindly reach out to our church office.</p>

    <h3 class="heading xl-10">Ushers</h3>
    <p class="content">Ushers fulfill a welcoming role as congregants gather for Mass, offering assistance in finding seating within the assembly. Additionally,
      they collect offerings on behalf of the church and express gratitude for attendees'
      presence and participation as they depart.</p>
