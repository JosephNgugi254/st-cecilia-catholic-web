          <h2 class="heading">BAPTISM</h2>
          <p class="content">Baptism serves as the initial sacrament in the journey towards full membership in the Catholic Church. Through the symbolism of water, baptism represents themes of life and death, purification, and the transformative power of new beginnings. During the baptismal ceremony, whether for an infant or an individual of any age,
            we commemorate and contemplate the boundless love of God as we embrace them into our faith community.</p>
          <h2 class="heading">REQUIREMENTS</h2> 
          <p class="content">To proceed with the baptism of your child, the following criteria should be met.<br>
            1. At least one parent must be actively involved in a Jumuiya within our church.<br>
            2. Both parents and the child are expected to attend preparation classes held every Sunday following the first Mass.<br>
            3. The chosen godparent must be a confirmed Catholic,
            actively practicing their faith, and committed to guiding and nurturing their godchild's spiritual journey.<br>
