          <h2 class="heading">MATRIMONY</h2>
          <p class="content">Holy Matrimony, also known as the Sacrament of Marriage, is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman, established and blessed by God within the community of faith. At St. Cecilia Catholic Church, we hold the institution of marriage in the highest esteem,
             recognizing it as a reflection of God's love and a source of grace for couples.<br><br>
             In the Sacrament of Holy Matrimony, a man and a woman enter into a lifelong commitment to love and support each other, to honor and cherish one another, and to build a family founded on faith and mutual respect. Through their vows exchanged before God and the Church, they become united as one flesh,
             joining together in a bond that is both spiritual and physical.<br><br>
             Marriage is not only a union of two individuals but also a partnership with God, who is present in the love shared between husband and wife. Through the grace of the sacrament, couples are empowered to grow in love,
             to face life's challenges together, and to nurture a family rooted in Christian values.<br><br>
             At St. Cecilia Catholic Church, we are committed to supporting couples in their journey of marriage, offering premarital counseling, spiritual guidance, and the celebration of the sacrament within the context of the Church's rich tradition. We believe that marriage is a sacred vocation, 
             calling couples to live out their love in service to one another and to the greater community of faith.
