          <p class="content"> The Sacrament of Confirmation is a significant milestone in the spiritual journey of our members. Confirmation, also known as the Sacrament of Chrismation, is a sacred rite through which individuals affirm their faith and receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
            During the Sacrament of Confirmation, candidates are anointed with chrism oil by a bishop or priest, and through the laying on of hands, they are sealed with the Holy Spirit. This sacrament strengthens and deepens their baptismal commitment to Christ and His Church, empowering them to be courageous witnesses of the Gospel.<br><br>            
            At St. Cecilia Catholic Church, we recognize Confirmation as a moment of grace and empowerment for our members. Through this sacrament, individuals are equipped with the gifts of wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord, enabling them to live out their faith with zeal and conviction.<br>            
            We encourage all members of our faith community to embrace the Sacrament of Confirmation as an opportunity for spiritual growth and renewal. Through prayer, preparation, and participation in the sacramental life of the Church, candidates are prepared to receive the fullness of the Holy Spirit and embark on a lifelong journey of discipleship and service.
