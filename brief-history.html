          <h2 style="font-size:2rem ;">History of St Cecilia Catholic Church Isinya</h2>
          <p class="content">The inception of Isinya Catholic Church started in 1979 as is documented in the book, <i>“The Mission to the Maasai”</i>.
            The late Bishop Colin Davis notes that, <i>“Isinya church was not planned out of the blue, I received a call from Vice President Professor George Saitoti to ask whether I would accept a gift of 2 acres plot at Isinya,
            it was on the main Nairobi – Arusha Road some 22 Kms North of Kajiado town.The one condition he laid was that the diocese had to build a church immediately.
            He was not prepared to give the plot if we did not use it with unnecessary delay.The plot was some 500 meters from the shops and immediately opposite the large Arap Moi Girls Secondary Boarding school.  It was ideal for our apostolate to the Girls school.
            I accepted the land and had to urgently scrape money to begin building.About that time I was in touch with a church of St. Cecilia in Germany.
            I requested the church there to “twin” with Isinya and in that way I managed to solve most of the financial problems”.</i>
            <br><br>
            In 1985 Isinya Catholic Church was opened as an outstation of St. John’s the Evangelist–Kajiado.
            It started off at Isinya Township in the plot of the Late Peter Thiongo and Margaret Wangechi.
            The couple had given out their Kitchen room as a place for Catholic faithful to pray.
            It started off with two families i.e.. the late Thiongo’s Family and Caleb Family. Fr. Richard Barabara, the then Parish Priest of St. John the Evangelist - Kajiado is remembered for having assigned a volunteer catechist for the station. As the result of the catechist’s presence, more members came in the following year in 1986 and the kitchen room was no longer enough.
            They were forced to move under a tree in the current DO’s/ chief’s office.
            Due to strong winds and rains, among other challenges the families decided to donate iron sheets and build the first semi-permanent church.
            The land belonged to the government.
            <br><Br>
            In 1989, honorable George Saitoti came and noticed the Catholic structure and he was touched. He immediately volunteered to donate land for the Catholic Church.
            The priest by then Fr. Jan Van Dyke (1981–1986) Fr. Ilkimojino or Kidole and the church leaders Shompole, Olempitii and Margaret Wangechi approached Hon. Saitoti who gave 2 acres of land where the current church lies.
            In 1992, the Isinya Catholic church moved to the two acre land donated by Prof. Saitoti,
            opposite Arap Moi Secondary school, its current location.The church had grown to about nine families: Thiong’o, Olempitii, Wairumwe, Felistus waWambui, Mwalimu Mutua and Mbashe. On the inauguration, Bishop Colin Davis moved around the compound blessing it with milk brought by Faith Kasalu. The blessing was aided by Thiong’o, Olempiti, Mbashe and Faith Kasalu.
            Finally all the people celebrated by eating a bull donated by Mzee Olempitii.
            <br><br>
            Later that year the permanent church was built and the church begun to be more vibrant. The church community grew and incorporated the school apostolate. Over a hundred girls were keen YCS members and appreciated the Sunday Masses. YCS was quite strong in the school and the priests in Kajiado offered good spiritual service to the school within the limits of their availability.
            A permanent catechist was present to offer services to the fast-growing township.
            The following catechists are among those who served in Isinya-; Samuel Mugusu, Paul Sinoni, John Muriuki, Paul Gathongo, Paul Mang’oka, Gabriel Odhiambo,
            Joseph Tongei, Benjamin Langat, Philip Tue, Teddy Obel, Peter Kasaine, Elias Nyapaya, William Korir and Patrick Tito.
            <br><br>
            From 1985 to 2023, the church has registered 463 infant baptisms and 303 adult baptisms, giving a total of 768 neophites.
            In late 2000 the Christians of Isinya later added half an acre from the initial 2 acres donated by the late Hon. George Saittoti and a Rectory was started in mid-2010’s.
